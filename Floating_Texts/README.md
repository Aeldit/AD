## This datapack allows you to create floating texts, using text displays

You can then change the color and the decoration (bold, underlined, ...) of the text in 3 different ways :

1. With the book, that can be obtained in survival but requires the minimum OP level for commands
2. With the chat, which also requires the function commands permission
3. With dyes (and other items that are easy to obtain in survival), which is fully survival and does not require any OP permission
